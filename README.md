# Memory Lane

The purpose of our mobile application is to use reminiscence therapy to enhance the quality of everyday life of people with dementia (PWD) by helping them recall moments of their past and the times spent with close friends, family members, and caregivers. Reminiscence therapy improves the quality of life in PWD by reducing stress, increasing their self-esteem and helping them reconnect with memories of their life [1,2]. Our application aims to achieve these benefits along with reducing cognitive decline by challenging users to recognise randomly chosen images of individuals or memorabilia and strengthen connections with memories pertaining to these individuals or memorabilia through questions presented in the application.

The application will allow users to upload photos, videos, audios, and create questions that help recollect who or what the photo is about to develop a deeper connection to the image. The application will use these images, videos, audios and questions to create an exercise for people with dementia in the hopes of providing reminiscence therapy to them. The videos will play after the user has answered all the question in a question set and then will move onto the next question set with the new image, video and new audio files for each of the questions in a question set.

The exercise will function in the following way:


1.	From images or videos uploaded by a person with dementia, the software will randomly choose an image and show it to the user. 
2.	Users are challenged to identify who or what is being depicted in the photographs by selecting an answer from the choices provided.
    a.	If the correct answer was chosen, the system will proceed to another question related to the individual or object in the picture, prompting the user to reflect on related memories with the picture. With every correct answer given, the system will delve deeper into who or what the primary picture was and their/its relationship with the PWD.
    b.	If an incorrect answer was chosen, the system will eliminate that answer as a choice, reducing any related frustrations. The application will also provide a hint in the form of an audio recording after the incorrect answer was given.
3.	Once the user has encountered all questions related to an image, the application will display the next person or object from the database based on a randomization algorithm. This randomization algorithm will be based on the number of correct answers chosen by the user. Images that were incorrectly recognized will have a higher chance of forming up the next question.
4.	The game will continue until the user has decided to end the game.
